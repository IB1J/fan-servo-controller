# fan-servo-controller
First hardware project powered by arduino
----------------

Small "controller" hooked up to an Arduino Uno which controls a servo and a DC motor mounted ontop of it.

### Key Learning Outcomes
* PWM motor control
* Bidirectional joystick input
* Servo movement with proper angle mapping
* Throttle curve using magnitude of Y-axis
* Mechanical mounting and control logic
